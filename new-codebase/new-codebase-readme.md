## How to use Copilot with a new code base

When checking out a new code base, CoPilot will primarily focus on the selected editor window and then use any open files are supplemental input.   If you have a file open that is not in the same directory as the selected editor window, CoPilot will not be able to use that file as input.  If you have a file open that is in the same directory as the selected editor window, CoPilot will use that file as input.  If you have multiple files open that are in the same directory as the selected editor window, CoPilot will use all of those files as input.
