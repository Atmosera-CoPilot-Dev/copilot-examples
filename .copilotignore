# The .copilot_ignore file is used to specify which files or directories GitHub Copilot should ignore when making suggestions. It works similarly to a .gitignore file.
# For example, if you have a directory of sensitive data that you don't want Copilot to use for suggestions, you can add that directory to your .copilot_ignore file.

# See https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot-business/configuring-content-exclusions-for-github-copilot for more information.
