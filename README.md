# copilot-examples
Code snippets and examples demonstrating GH Copilot functionality


Here's a quick rundown of the modules and a suggested order of presenting:

* Simple prompts in code editor to ask questions. See [development-q-and-a](./development-q-and-a/) - Here are just some simple prompts in Javascript comments to show how Copilot makes in editor suggestions.
* Basic function and unit test building. See [regexp](./regexp/) - Here's we'll build a regular expression, a function to check if an input is a regexp match and some unit tests to verify the function works.
* API. See [api](./api/) - Here we'll use Copilot to build a simple API that returns the weather for a given latitude and longitude. This covers also just building a simple command-line utility.
* Architecture. See [architecture](./architecture/) - Here we'll use Copilot to build a simple architecture diagram using Mermaid. 
* Markdown. See [markdown](./markdown/) - Here we'll use Copilot to build a simple markdown document with a table of contents and some sections.
* Code translation. See [translate-code](./translate-code/) - Here we'll use Copilot to translate some code from Python to Go.
* SQL. See [sql](./sql/) - Here we'll use Copilot to build a simple SQL queries on a 3 table DB.
* Security. See [security](./security/) - Here we have a python script that suffers from SQL injection. We'll ask Copilot if there are any vulnerabilities and it will suggest a fix.
* Getting up to speed on a new code base. See [new-codebase](./new-codebase/) - Here we'll look at how you can use Copilot to get up to speed on a new code base.
