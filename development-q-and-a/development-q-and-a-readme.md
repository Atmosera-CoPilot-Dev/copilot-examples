# Summary

This is an initial starter example to show very basic functionality of Copilot. We'll show the basics of how to generate prompts in the code editor as well as Copilot chat to answer basic questions. It's like having a pocket reference for all things software development at your finger tips!

# Examples of prompts in CoPilot using simple comments

`// Q: What does STRIDE stand for in Application Security?`

`// Q: Explain how TLS works`
