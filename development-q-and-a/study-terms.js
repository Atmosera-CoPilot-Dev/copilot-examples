// Q: What does STRIDE stand for in Application Security?
// A: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
// Spoofing: Pretending to be someone else
// Tampering: Changing data
// Repudiation: Claiming you didn't do something
// Information Disclosure: Revealing information
// Denial of Service: Preventing access to a resource
// Elevation of Privilege: Gaining access to a resource you shouldn't have access to


// Q: Explain how TLS works
// A: TLS is a protocol that uses asymmetric encryption to establish a shared secret
//    between two parties. It uses a combination of public and private keys to encrypt
//    data that is sent between two parties. The public key is used to encrypt data, and
//    the private key is used to decrypt data. The public key can be shared with anyone,
//    but the private key should be kept secret. The private key is used to decrypt data
//    that has been encrypted with the public key. The public key can be used to verify
//    that the private key is authentic. The private key can be used to verify that the
//    public key is authentic. The public key can be used to verify that the
//    private key is authentic. The private key can be used to verify that the
//    public key is authentic. The private key can be used to verify that the
//    public key is authentic. The private key can be used to verify that the

// Q: What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?
// A: Symmetric encryption uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. Asymmetric encryption uses a different key to encrypt and decrypt data.
