# Summary

This module shows a couple of examples of generating regular expressions from code comments as promppts, generating a function to test if a pattern follows the regexp and finally some examples of running a unit test.

# Sample prompts

```
// Global regular expression for email validation
```

```
// Function that checks if an email address is valid. Returns true if valid, false otherwise.
```

```
// Unit tests for isEmail function.
